# Reverse-the-Digits

**write a program to reverse the digits of a given two-digit number.**

Input: 21

Output: 12

Let's break down the solution for the coding question 'Reverse the Digits' into simple steps.

Step 1: Read the number
First, we need to read the two-digit number from the user. We'll use the input() function to get the number as a string.0

Step 2: Get individual digits
Now, we'll extract each digit from the given number. Since word is a string, we can access its characters using their positions (starting from 0).

Step 3: Reverse the digits
Next, we'll reverse the digits by swapping their positions.

Step 4: Display the result
Finally, we'll print the reversed number using the print() function.
